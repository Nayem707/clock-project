**HTML5** is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used for structuring and presenting content on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). It is the fifth and final[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-W3C_transfer_ZDNet-3) major [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) version that is a [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the [HTML Living Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Living_Standard). It is maintained by the [Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group) (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors ([Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla), and [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)).

HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-HTML5v1-2) with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-finalars-4)[<sup>[5]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-5) Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia) and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing), etc., without [XHTML's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) rigidity; and to remain [backward-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward-compatible) with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only [HTML 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_4) but also XHTML 1 and [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) Level 2 HTML.[<sup>[6]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-HTML5diffHTML4-quote-6)

HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (APIs) for complex [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application).[<sup>[7]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-HTML5diffHTML4-7) For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

Many new [syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and [graphical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics) content, the new [`<video>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video), [`<audio>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio) and [`<canvas>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element) were added, expandable sections are natively implemented through `<summary>...</summary>` and `<details>...</details>` rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript, and support for [scalable vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_vector_graphics) (SVG) content and [MathML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML) for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) content of documents, new page structure elements such as `<main>`, `<section>`, [`<article>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_element_(HTML5)), `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<figure>` are added. New [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute) were introduced, some elements and attributes were removed, and others such as `<a>`, `<cite>`, and `<menu>` were changed, redefined, or standardized. The APIs and [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification,[<sup>[7]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-HTML5diffHTML4-7) and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[<sup>[8]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-8)HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-HTML5v1-2) with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-finalars-4)[<sup>[5]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#cite_note-5) Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia) and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing), etc., without [XHTML's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) rigidity; and to remain [backwards-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward-compatible) with older software.
